Notebooks and other materials for the Data Containers tutorial
==============================================================

You can get the latest release of the materials here:

https://github.com/FrancescAlted/DataContainers/releases

Also, make sure that you have the next Python packages installed:

* numpy
* numexpr
* pandas
* bcolz
* tables (pytables)
* matplotlib
* psutil
* memory_profiler
* ipython_memwatcher

I recommend to use Anaconda to install most of the packages above, and for
the software that is not in anaconda.org repos, just use pip, e.g.::

  $ pip install ipython_memwatcher

and start by the different tutorials following the numerical order.

** Enjoy data! **
